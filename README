🌍 YAML Multilingual File Translator
Tired of manually translating your .yml files? This tool automates the translation of .yml files (like pt-br.yml) into multiple languages using the free google-translate-api-x. Streamline your localization process and keep your projects multilingual with ease!

🚀 Quick Start
Get your translations up and running in a few simple steps!

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Add your input file (e.g., pt-br.yml) to the root of the project. This will be the source for your translations.

Run the script, specifying your desired target languages:

Bash

node traduzir-linhas.js en es fr
This command will automatically generate en.yml, es.yml, and fr.yml files, each containing the translated content.

📁 Project Structure
To ensure the script works correctly, your project should follow this structure:

Plaintext

├── pt-br.yml           # Your input file with text in the source language (e.g., Portuguese)
├── traduzir-linhas.js  # The core translation script
⚙️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have:

Node.js 16+ installed on your system.
An active internet connection to access the translation API.
📝 Important Notes
API Usage: This tool leverages the unofficial and free Google Translate API via google-translate-api-x.
Translation Speed: Translating extensive files can take some time. The script is designed to handle this by automatically managing pauses and retries.
Error Logging: Any errors encountered during the translation process will be logged and saved in the logs/ directory for easy debugging.
⚠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter a "module not found" error for google-translate-api-x, you can manually install it:

Bash

npm install google-translate-api-x
